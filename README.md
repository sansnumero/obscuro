## TODOs:
- Tests
- Introduce `article`
- Cascade deletes on users/comments and once there are articles, on article deletion
- Introduce `vote`s with types `upvote`/`downvote`
- Timestamp conversion
- Better naming
- Learn a bit more about conventions around services/helpers/models
- Remove database id exposure in the front end
